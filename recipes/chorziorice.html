                </li>
            <li>2 capsicum red and yellow, diced
                </li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas
                </li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn
                </li>
            <li>3-3 ½ cups chicken stock
                </li>
            <li>3 tbsp tomato paste
                </li>
            <li>juice of half a lime
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large, non-stick frying pan or French pan, heat the oil over medium heat. 
                Add the chorizo slices and fry, until the chorizo has become crispy and browned around the edges. 
                Remove the chorizo from the pan and set aside for later.
                </li>
            <li>Leaving the oil from the cooked chorizo in the pan over medium heat, 
                add the onion, garlic, paprika, cumin, pepper and chilli powder and stir until fragrant. 
                Add the rice and stir for a few minutes, until the rice becomes clear.
                </li>
            <li>Add the vegetables, stock and tomato paste and stir. Bring to a low simmer.
                </li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered, for 10-15 minutes, 
                until the rice has almost cooked through. You may need to stir the rice once or twice to prevent sticking. 
                Keep an eye on the amount of stock in the dish, as it will absorb into the rice while cooking. Add a little more, if required.
                </li>
            <li>Add the chorizo back into the pan, stir and cover. Turn the heat off and allow to sit, covered, for around 5 minutes.
                </li>
            <li>Stir through the lime juice and parsley and serve immediately, with extra lime wedges.
                </li>
        </ol>
